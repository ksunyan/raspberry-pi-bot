# Raspberry Pi Robot
The intent of this project is to build a small robot capable of driving around a house and identifying common household objects.
# Project Stages
The project will be completed in stages:
*Stage I will be to create a robot that can drive with commands from a laptop or smartphone. 
*Stage II will be to implement object recognition with OpenCV. 
*Stage III will be to make the robot drive autonomously. 
*Stage IV will be to give the robot the ability to manipulate identified objects on the floor (e.g. move socks towards the closet, move books towards the bookshelf).
